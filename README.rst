Bee colony vitality using audio analysis
########################################


************
Introduction
************
The people around `Open Source Beehives (OSBH) <https://opensourcebeehives.com/>`_ were directing towards audio from the very beginning and therefore presenting coefficients which where won via `machine learning <https://github.com/opensourcebeehives/MachineLearning-Local>`_, learned via the `audio-samples <https://www.dropbox.com/sh/us1633xi4cmtecl/AAA6hplscuDR7aS_f73oRNyha?dl=0>`_ they had so far.

The output is simply the activity/health status of a bee colony. So far the algorithm can tell whether the colony is dormant, active, pre-, post- or swarming, if the queen is missing or hatching. For more background information about the audio processing, please follow up reading
`current work status thread in the OSBH Forum <https://community.akerkits.com/t/main-thread-current-work-status/326>`_.
So far, the results are promising.

We forked the "`OSBH machine learning <https://github.com/opensourcebeehives/MachineLearning-Local>`_" repository to `osbh-audioanalyzer <https://github.com/hiveeyes/osbh-audioanalyzer>`_ to make it able to obtain an input file option. The wrapper script resides in the [audiohealth] repository.

    Result
    ======
    The most common events (i.e. the events with the highest total duration) are:

         The colony is mostly in »PRE-SWARM« state, which is going on for 320 seconds.
         Sometimes, the state oscillates to »ACTIVE«, for 280 seconds in total.

    $ audiohealth --help

    Usage:
      audiohealth analyze --audiofile audiofile --analyzer /path/to/osbh-audioanalyzer [--strategy lr-2.1] [--debug] [--keep]
      audiohealth analyze --wavfile wavfile --analyzer /path/to/osbh-audioanalyzer [--strategy lr-2.1] [--debug]
      audiohealth analyze --datfile datfile --analyzer /path/to/osbh-audioanalyzer [--strategy lr-2.1] [--debug]
      audiohealth convert --audiofile audiofile --wavfile wavfile
      audiohealth spectrogram --audiofile audiofile --pngfile pngfile

      audiohealth power   --wavfile wavfile     --pngfile pngfile
      audiohealth --version
      audiohealth (-h | --help)

    Options:
      --wavfile=<wavfile>       Name of .wav file
      --pngfile=<pngfile>       Output .png file of power spectrum
      --audiofile=<audiofile>   Process audiofile. Please use sox-compatible input formats.
      --datfile=<datfile>       Process datfile.
      --analyzer=<analyzer>     Path to OSBH audioanalyzer binary
      --strategy=<strategy>     The classification strategy. One of dt-0.9, dt-1.0, dt-2.0, lr-2.0, lr-2.1
      --keep                    Keep (don't delete) downsampled and .dat file
      --debug                   Enable debug messages
      -h --help                 Show this screen

Hint: By using ``--strategy dt-2.0`` or even ``--strategy dt-1.0``, different
classification strategies can be toggled to be able to compare results against each other.
``"dt-"`` means "decision tree", while ``"lr-"`` means "logistic regression".

The cutting edge classification strategy is ``"lr-2.0"``, which is also the default setting.
See also commit `Added new filters and logistic regression classifier <https://github.com/opensourcebeehives/MachineLearning-Local/commit/a40de504>`_. Aaron Makaruk describes it on 2017-07-01 like:

    Our classifier has been recently updated to include two new states, and we've moved past decision-tree algorithms to something yielding greater results.

Setup
*****

Repository
==========
::

    git clone --recursive https://github.com/hiveeyes/audiohealth
    cd audiohealth


Prerequisites
=============
To relieve your machine from compiling SciPy or NumPy, install the python libraries from your distribution. `audiohealth` furthermore relies on `sox <http://sox.sourceforge.net/Docs/Documentation>`_ for audio resampling.
We also recommend `youtube-dl <http://youtube-dl.org/>`_ for downloading audio samples from Youtube.

Install some distribution software packages (if you are not root, you might want to prefix the command with ``sudo``)::

    apt install python-virtualenv python-scipy python-numpy sox libsox-fmt-all xvfb xauth youtube-dl

Build the `osbh-audioanalyzer <https://github.com/hiveeyes/osbh-audioanalyzer>`_::

    make setup-osbh-audio-analyzer


Main program
============
::

    make setup-virtualenv
    source .venv/bin/activate

The driving force behind the audio signal processing at OSBH is `Javier Andrés Calvo <https://github.com/Jabors>`_, so we want to send a big thank you to him and the whole OSBH team - this program is really standing on the shoulders of giants. Keep up the good work!
